# hello-world

Kia ora GitHub!
Mel here. I'm a laboratory technician at Victoria University of Wellington's School of Biological Science in New Zealand.
Marine science is my main interest, but I enjoy everything ecology related - plants, animals, data analysis. 

I try to keep my R skills current by working on data sets in my down time at work. GitHub was a natural tool to work on as well.
